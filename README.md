# Todo App

In this project I buit a simple react app wich is "Todo list", using react. This app was built according to the steps provided in the React Tutorial From Scratch: A Step-by-Step Guide (2021)

It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

Add todo.
Update todo.
Delete todo.
Navigate between pages with react router.
Data in this app has been preserved using localStorage.
